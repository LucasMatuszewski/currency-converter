# Currency Converter

- UI build with [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) + SCSS,
- implemented context design based on [Kent C. Dodds article](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/how-to-use-react-context-effectively),
- foreign exchange rates from [this open API](http://exchangeratesapi.io/), based on European Central Bank data,
- you can follow my progress in GIT repo by commits and releases,
- todo ideas:
  - multi-select with checkboxes to choose destination currencies,
  - E2E tests with Cypress,
  - change exchange rates date in converter (date picker),
  - add currency to favorites (star icon on tile + save in local storage + tile color change),
  - add charts with currency trend in chosen period of time,
- build with CRA, to run use `npm i && npm start`, details below:

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
